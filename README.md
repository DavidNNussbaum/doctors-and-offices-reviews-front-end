# Doctors And Offices Reviews Front End

# Description
This site allows users to enter reviews of doctors and their offices as well as allowing viewers to see the reviews. This is the front end Javascript repository which is to be used in conjuction with the back end Ruby API repository (https://github.com/DavidNNussbaum/doctors-and-offices-reviews-back-end). 

# Installation
First download this repository, confirm that the back end is running utilizing rails s, then type explorer.exe index.html in the terminal and press enter. The site should appear in the browser.

# Usage
All actions are initiated from the navigation bar. One can view all doctors and reviews without the ability to add, edit or delete reviews by pressing the tab "Show Doctors And Then Reviews" by not signing in or logging in first. A doctor can then be chosen from the drop down menu which appears below and the reviews will be listed. Going back to the drop down menu and choosing another doctor will bring up that doctor's reviews. Pressing on "Return To The Original Screen" will return the screen to its original appearance.

One can also log in or sign on by pressing the appropriate tab on the navigation bar. Once that information has been entered, the "Show Doctors And Then Reviews" tab should be pressed. The user can add a doctor by pressing on the "Create A New Doctor" button and entering the information. Reviews for that doctor or any doctor can be created by pressing on the "Add A Review" button and entering the information. In addition, all doctors and reviews can be viewed, but only reviews created by that user can be edited or deleted. Going back to the drop down menu and choosing another doctor will bring up that doctor's reviews. Pressing on "Return To The Original Screen" will return the screen to its original appearance but the user will remain logged on. To log out, press on the "Log Out" tab on the navigation bar.
